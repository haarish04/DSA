Given arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station. Find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train is kept waiting.
Consider that all the trains arrive on the same day and leave on the same day. Arrival and departure time can never be the same for a train but we can have arrival time of one train equal to departure time of the other. At any given instance of time, same platform can not be used for both departure of a train and arrival of another train. In such cases, we need different platforms.


Example 1:

Input: n = 6 
arr[] = {0900, 0940, 0950, 1100, 1500, 1800}
dep[] = {0910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000}
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Minimum 3 platforms are required to 
safely arrive and depart all trains.
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
arr[] = {0900, 1100, 1235}
dep[] = {1000, 1200, 1240}
Output: 1
Explanation: Only 1 platform is required to 
safely manage the arrival and departure 
of all trains. 


class trains
{
    int time;
    char tag;
    
    trains(int time,char tag)
    {
        this.time=time;
        this.tag=tag;
        
    }
    
}

class mycomparator implements Comparator<trains>
{
    @Override public int compare(trains t1, trains t2)
    {
        if(t1.time==t2.time)
            return Character.compare(t1.tag, t2.tag);;
        return t1.time- t2.time;
    }
}

{
    //Function to find the minimum number of platforms required at the

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            trainlist.add(new trains(arr[i],'a'));
            trainlist.add(new trains(dep[i],'d'));
        }
        
        mycomparator mc=new mycomparator();
        Collections.sort(trainlist, mc);
        
        int res=1;
        int platforms=0;
        for(int i=0;i<trainlist.size();i++)
        {
            trains t= trainlist.get(i);
            if(t.tag=='a')
                platforms++;
            else
                platforms--;
            
            if(platforms>res)
                res=platforms;
                
        }
        return res;
        
        
        
    }
